## News

:star2: **What's New**

- [2023/6/25] Relase version 1.1.1, it includes a major bug fix and speed improvement.
- [2023/6/25] [Official Code](https://github.com/XingangPan/DragGAN) is released, check it out.
- [2023/5/29] A new version is in beta, install via `pip install draggan==1.1.0b2`, includes speed improvement and more models.
- [2023/5/25] DragGAN is on PyPI, simple install via `pip install draggan`. Also addressed the common CUDA problems https://github.com/Zeqiang-Lai/DragGAN/issues/38  https://github.com/Zeqiang-Lai/DragGAN/issues/12
- [2023/5/25] We now support StyleGAN2-ada with much higher quality and more types of images. Try it by selecting models started with "ada".
- [2023/5/24] An out-of-box online demo is integrated in [InternGPT](https://github.com/OpenGVLab/InternGPT) - a super cool pointing-language-driven visual interactive system. Enjoy for free.:lollipop:
- [2023/5/24] Custom Image with GAN inversion is supported, but it is possible that your custom images are distorted  due to the limitation of GAN inversion. Besides, it is also possible the manipulations fail due to the limitation of our implementation.
